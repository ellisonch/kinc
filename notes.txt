Free state and counts to 0

Why new so high

Not really using cap

What happens to labels

Can args be part of K structure one less pointer
-- yes, but then not flexible enough to deal with different kinds of lists

Cap of powers od 2 only

Pre in it garbage
-- doesn't seem to help at n = 10000

Function to turn cap into nth in series 1 2 4 8 12 16 20 etc

Since usually there is garbage left, only if at sentinel at bottom of garbage

If k had its own list pointer, could hold next k garbage and get next quick

Alloc mem in blocks and don't free

No sharing btw cells might help concurrency 

DO NOT MUTATE PERMANANT TSTUFF

get the k
set its arguments
init it



need nicer way to rep config inside of c
